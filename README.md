# Rock, Paper, Scissors
## Overview
- The webpage allows user to play a game of rock, paper, scissors against a cpu. This project was a solo project designed to showcase
what students have learned during their first module of Turing.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo-v2.html).

## Learning Goals

- Solidify and demonstrate understanding of: DRY Javascript and event delegation
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step

## Introduction
  - The purpose of this solo project was to design a game of rock, paper, scissors. Users should be able to choose from two modes. In this case: Classic and Kirbo.
  Classic mode is just the basic game of rock, paper, scissors. On the other hand, kirbo mode adds two more options players can choose from in addition to the original 3 choices.
  The user will be playing against a CPU who's choices will be decided randomly once the user selects their choice.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
- Users can decide between playing classic or kirbo mode
- Users will play against a CPU who's choice are randomly generated when the user make a choice.
- The user will be able to see what choice they made and what choice the CPU made
- When the user wins/loses/or draws the win counter will adjust respectively
- Users can change modes by clicking the "change mode" button to go back to the main menu.
- The users and cpu wins will persist when user changes modes/refreshes the page.
- To reset the score, users can click on the "reset score" button
- users will be able to play music during kirbo mode to add ambience. if they wish to mute or adjust the volume, users can do so by going to the audio
controls.
- music will keep playing if the user decides to change modes if they did not pause the audio.

## Deployed Page

N/A as it is a private repository for now. I will add a deployed page on 06/15/22

## Possible Future Extensions
- Have the music stop if the user forgot to pause the audio when they change modes
- Implement a different mode that does not have the original rock, paper, scissors buttons.
- Have an icon appear to show what the player chose before the results are displayed.
